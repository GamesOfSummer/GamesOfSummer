What I do -

* 🖥 Sling code - I've loved code and technical problems since I was wee lass!
* ☑️ Lead + Mentor - I've been leading teams for nearly 2 decades 
* 📅 Play PM - I love to produce! Let me produce! I'll come up with reasonable timelimes and expectations, and since I'm a dev first, I'm not lost on how long something actually takes to develop!
* 🔧 Introduce standards - You don't unit test in the game industry, but I'd like to help setup your CI/CD pipeline and manage PR reviews for you! 
* 🗣️ Open and honest - talk and walk you through any step of the journey
* 👏 Have fun - I'm a silly goober. Expect memes out of me, _constantly_
 
Additionally -

* 🌞 I am very bubbly and easy to talk too!
* 🤠 Yeehaw! I am a US Citizen currently living in Dallas, TX.
* 🗺️ Remote only
